# # Combining R data frames by row

# data frames vertically, adding the rows of the second
# at the bottom of the first. This is equivalent to

# To remove duplicates from the combined result, like 
# the SQL operator `UNION DISTINCT` does, use the dplyr
# function `distinct()` after combining the data frames.
# For example, the following series of operations
# combines the `games` and `more_games` data frames, 
# selects only the `min_players` and `max_players` 
# columns, and returns only the distinct (unique) rows 
# (the rows with unique combinations of `min_players`
# and `max_players`).
