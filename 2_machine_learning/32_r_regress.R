# # Regression models with R

# This example demonstrates a simple linear regression
# modeling task, first using R's built-in `lm()` function
# then using the `rpart()` function in the 
# [rpart](https://cran.r-project.org/package=randomForest)
# package.


# ## 0. Preliminaries

# Load the required packages
library(readr)
library(rpart)


# ## 1. Load data

# Load data representing one brand of chess set ("set A")
chess <- read_csv("data/chess/one_chess_set.csv")

# View the data
chess


# ## 2. Prepare data

# Split the data into an 80% training set and a 20%
# evaluation (test) set
train_frac <- 0.8
indices <- sample.int(
  n = nrow(chess),
  size = floor(train_frac * nrow(chess))
)
chess_train <- chess[indices, ]
chess_test  <- chess[-indices, ]


# ## 3 and 4. Specify and train model

# In R, you do not need to instantiate an estimator 
# object before training a model. Instead, you train
# the model directly by calling the appropriate
# function. For a simple linear regression model, the
# function is `lm()`.

# R uses a formula notation to specify models. The 
# formula for a simple model with one predictor variable
# (`x`) and one response variable (`y`) is `y ~ x`
model <- lm(
  weight ~ base_diameter,
  data = chess_train
)

# Other models in R (including those in contributed R
# packages) typically use the same basic syntax and the
# same formula notation as the `lm()` function.

# For example, you could use the `rpart()` function
# in the rpart package simply by replacing `lm` with 
# `rpart`:
model2 <- rpart(
  weight ~ base_diameter,
  data = chess_train
)

# However, the objects that these different model training 
# functions return are very different, and the steps to
# evaluate the model are different depending on which 
# function you use.


# ## Next steps

# Instead of calling these different model training 
# functions directly, many R users instead use the
# [caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html)
# package, which was designed to help wrestle the 
# numerous different machine learning functions in
# different R packages into a more uniform interface, 
# and to standardize common tasks such as training 
# and evaluating models.

# However, the caret package has some shortcomings,
# so it is currently being redesigned as a new package
# called [parsnip](https://tidymodels.github.io/parsnip/).
# The parsnip package is a part of the
# [tidymodels](https://github.com/tidymodels) collection
# of packages, which is being developed to standardize
# all the important steps of the modeling process in R.
